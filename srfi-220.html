  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>Many language-agnostic programming tools rely on specially
  formatted source code comments to annotate the code with
  metadata. Such "magic comments" are hard for both humans and
  computers to parse reliably, as the purpose of a comment is to be
  free-form text that is not interpreted by machine.</p>
  <p>This SRFI extends the standard Scheme directive syntax
  (<code>#!</code>) to support <em>line directives</em>. They look
  like magic comments to language-agnostic tools but read as
  S-expressions in Scheme, combining the portability of magic
  comments with the well-defined syntax and easy parsing of
  ordinary Scheme code.</p>
  <h2>Withdrawal notice</h2>
  <p>While this SRFI solves the problem it set out to solve, and
  could be used as-is, the mailing list disagreed with it on
  aesthetic grounds. No maintainers of established Scheme
  implementations commented on the proposal.</p>
  <p>Hence the SRFI is withdrawn. The document and the mailing list
  archive stay as a reference for future discussions on the
  topic.</p>
  <p>Particular points of contention:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Whether source code comments should ever be parsed or
    not.</li>
    <li>Whether magic comments are a horrible aesthetic blemish or
    an acceptable tradeoff to embed external syntax into a
    programming language.</li>
    <li>Whether Scheme's <code>#!</code> read syntax should be kept
    strictly for Scheme datums or overloaded to also handle
    external syntax.</li>
    <li>Whether Unix-style <code>#!/usr/bin/scheme</code> shebang
    lines should be incorporated into Scheme syntax in some way, or
    removed in a pre-processing step so the Scheme reader never
    sees them. (Both approaches are currently in use by Scheme
    implementations.)</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Issues</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Should this SRFI specify that keywords are normalized into
    symbols?</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Rationale</h2>
  <p>Like other Lisp dialects, Scheme uses S-expressions for its
  surface syntax. S-expressions are naturally extensible: just use
  a particular symbol as the head of a list to indicate what's
  coming up in the rest of the list. Ideally we would use
  S-expressions not only for data, but also to write metadata such
  as license information, character encoding, and editor
  settings.</p>
  <p>However, most programming languages have a much less regular
  and more ad-hoc syntax and do not have easily extensible
  syntactic constructs. To the extent that extensible constructs
  exist, the culture to use them is lacking. As a result, most
  languages eventually paint themselves into a corner when the time
  comes to augment source code with metadata. As a last resort, the
  metadata is snuck into comments which are ignored by the
  compiler. This is unfortunate as comments are meant for natural
  language text and deliberately have no syntactic structure to be
  parsed, checked, and enforced by the compiler. That makes tools
  dealing with magic comments very brittle, and their precise
  behavior difficult to understand.</p>
  <p>For interoperability with language-agnostic tools such as text
  editors and license checkers, we need to play along with the mess
  caused by the lack of foresight in other languages. However, we
  can salvage a bit of rigor by parsing the directives that other
  languages put in a comment as a sequence of S-expressions in
  Scheme. Happily, the character set permitted in Scheme and Lisp
  symbols is so wide that most magic comments (which tend to
  contain alphanumeric characters and some punctuation delimited by
  whitespace) will naturally split into a list of symbols.</p>
  <p>If we can turn each directive into a list of symbols, it
  becomes easy to programmatically find all the directives in a
  Scheme source file. A Scheme implementation can process the
  directives it understands, ignore the rest, and optionally let
  users install custom hooks to process directives.</p>
  <h3>Symbols and keywords</h3>
  <p>Some Scheme implementations have read syntax for
  <em>keywords</em>. The following syntaxes are known to exist:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>foo:</code></li>
    <li><code>:foo</code></li>
    <li><code>#:foo</code></li>
  </ul>
  <p>It also varies whether or not keywords are disjoint from
  symbols.</p>
  <p>The presence of keyword syntax may cause some tokens that are
  read as symbols in most Scheme implementations to be read as
  keywords in others. Language-agnostic directives tend to use
  colons a lot, which may cause them to be parsed differently in
  Scheme implementations with keywords.</p>
  <h3>Why use #! as a directive marker</h3>
  <p>In Scheme, a semicolon (<code>;</code>) starts a comment that
  runs until the end of the line. In RnRS parlance, this is called
  a <em>line comment</em>. An identifier following <code>#!</code>
  is called a <em>directive</em>. Combining these two terms, we
  arrive at <em>line directive</em>: a directive that runs until
  the end of the line.</p>
  <p><code>#!</code> is the best choice for a directive marker
  because most Scheme script readers already need special handling
  for <code>#!</code> appearing at the very beginning of a source
  file since <code>#!</code> is the Unix indicator that says which
  interpreter runs the script. (When the first line of a Unix
  script starts with <code>#!</code> it is often called the
  "shebang line", or the "hashbang line".)</p>
  <p><code>#!</code> is also the only syntax used for reader
  directives in standard Scheme, and a declaration of something
  like character encoding is conceptually close to such
  directives.</p>
  <h3>Survey of #! syntax in Lisp standards</h3>
  <h4>Common Lisp</h4>
  <p>The ANSI Common Lisp standard, section <a href=
  "http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/02_dh.htm">2.4.8 Syntax -&gt; Standard
  Macro Characters -&gt; Sharpsign</a>, says the dispatch macro
  character <code>#!</code> is explicitly reserved to the user. No
  conforming implementation defines it.</p>
  <h4>ISLisp</h4>
  <p>The <a href=
  "https://web.archive.org/web/20160313021746/http://islisp.info/Documents/PDF/islisp-2007-03-17-pd-v23.pdf">
  ISLisp standard</a> (2007) uses <code>#</code> as a dispatch
  macro character like Common Lisp and Scheme. It does not appear
  to use <code>#!</code> for anything.</p>
  <h4>Scheme</h4>
  <p>Scheme standards treat <code>#!</code> as a magic marker
  generally followed by a directive that looks like an identifier
  but serves a special purpose distinct from an ordinary identifier
  with the same spelling.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>R<sup>2</sup>RS uses <code>#!true</code> and
    <code>#!false</code> for booleans and <code>#!null</code> for
    the empty list.</li>
    <li>R<sup>3</sup>RS does not use <code>#!</code>.</li>
    <li>R<sup>4</sup>RS does not use <code>#!</code>.</li>
    <li>R<sup>5</sup>RS does not use <code>#!</code>.</li>
    <li>R<sup>6</sup>RS uses <code>#!r6rs</code> and permits any
    other identifier.</li>
    <li>R<sup>7</sup>RS uses <code>#!fold-case</code> and
    <code>#!no-fold-case</code>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>DSSSL and SRFI 89 use <code>#!key</code> and
  <code>#!optional</code> and <code>#!rest</code> for lambda list
  markers.</p>
  <p>Various Scheme implementations use other identifiers following
  <code>#!</code> for <a href=
  "https://registry.scheme.org/#hash-bang-syntax">other
  purposes</a>.</p>
  <p>SRFI 22 (<em>Running Scheme Scripts on Unix</em>) recognizes
  <code>#!</code> at the very beginning of the file as starting a
  comment that runs until the end of the line.</p>
  <p>Guile uses <code>#!...!#</code> anywhere in the file for
  multi-line comments.</p>
  <h3>Survey of #! syntax in non-standard Lisp dialects</h3>
  <h4>AutoLisp</h4>
  <p><code>#</code> is a constituent character in symbols.
  <code>#!</code> does not appear to be used for anything.</p>
  <h4>Clojure and ClojureScript</h4>
  <p><code>#!</code> <strong>unofficially</strong> begins a comment
  that runs until the end of the line.</p>
  <p>Source: In the Clojure codebase, open
  <code>src/jvm/clojure/lang/LispReader.java</code> and look for
  <code>dispatchMacros['!'] = new CommentReader();</code>.</p>
  <h4>Emacs Lisp</h4>
  <p><code>#!</code> <strong>unofficially</strong> begins a comment
  that runs until the end of the line.</p>
  <p>Source: In the GNU Emacs codebase, open
  <code>src/lread.c</code> and look inside <code>read1()</code>.
  The comment in the source code says <code>#! appears at the
  beginning of an executable file. Skip the first line.</code> but
  the code actually skips <code>#!</code> anywhere in the file.</p>
  <h4>Fennel</h4>
  <p><code>#!</code> at the very <strong>beginning of the
  file</strong> starts a comment that runs until the end of the
  line.</p>
  <p>Source: In the Fennel codebase, open
  <code>src/fennel/parser.fnl</code> and look inside
  <code>string-stream</code>. It replaces a <code>#!</code> at the
  start of the file with a traditional <code>;;</code> comment
  prefix.</p>
  <h4>Hy</h4>
  <p><code>#</code> begins a comment that runs until the end of the
  line. By extension, <code>#!</code> does the same.</p>
  <h4>Janet</h4>
  <p><code>#</code> <strong>officially</strong> begins a comment
  that runs until the end of the line. By extension,
  <code>#!</code> does the same.</p>
  <h4>Lisp Flavored Erlang</h4>
  <p><code>#</code> is a constituent character in symbols.
  Otherwise <code>#</code> does not appear to be used for anything,
  and causes an <code>illegal character</code> syntax error.</p>
  <h4>NewLisp</h4>
  <p><code>#</code> <strong>officially</strong> begins a comment
  that runs until the end of the line. By extension,
  <code>#!</code> does the same.</p>
  <h4>PicoLisp</h4>
  <p><code>#</code> <strong>officially</strong> begins a comment
  that runs until the end of the line. By extension,
  <code>#!</code> does the same.</p>
  <p>As a minor exception, <code>#</code> does not begin a comment
  when it is part of a symbol.</p>
  <h4>Rep (librep)</h4>
  <p><code>#!...!#</code> at the very <strong>beginning of the
  file</strong> is treated like a comment.</p>
  <p>Elsewhere in the file <code>#!key</code> and
  <code>#!optional</code> and <code>#!rest</code> are read in as
  symbols, and <code>#!</code> followed by anything else is a
  syntax error.</p>
  <p>Source: In the <code>librep</code> codebase, open
  <code>src/lisp.c</code> and look inside <code>readl()</code>.</p>
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>Both major Lisp standards, Common Lisp and Scheme, are easily
  amenable to adding a <code>#!</code> syntax. While Common Lisp
  reserves <code>#!</code> for users, customizing the readtable is
  quite rare in practice, and the pervasive use of <code>#!</code>
  in Unix scripts makes it unlikely that Common Lisp users would
  configure <code>#!</code> to do anything other than read a
  comment.</p>
  <p>Of the surveyed non-standard Lisp dialects, all except
  AutoLisp, Fennel, Lisp Flavored Erlang, and Rep handle
  <code>#!</code> anywhere in the file akin to a comment. Both
  Fennel and Rep handle <code>#!</code> at the beginning of the
  file as a comment, which means their syntax could easily be
  amended to handle <code>#!</code> elsewhere in the file the same
  way. AutoLisp and LFE permit <code>#</code> in symbols. LFE does
  not permit <code>#</code> to start a symbol; perhaps AutoLisp
  doesn't either. If so, adding special meaning to <code>#!</code>
  would not present a conflict in these dialects either.</p>
  <p>Guile and Rep use <code>#!...!#</code> comments, i.e. they
  require a <code>!#</code> at the end. We can expect
  <code>!#</code> to cause a read error in most Scheme
  implementations. However, using <code>;!#</code> causes it to be
  treated as an ordinary comment that runs until the end of the
  line in those Schemes.</p>
  <h2>Specification</h2>
  <p>Scheme's read syntax is extended such that the two-character
  sequence <code>#!</code> followed immediately by either a
  newline, the end of the file, or one or more horizontal
  whitespace characters causes a line directive to be read as
  follows:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Start accumulating elements into an empty list.</li>
    <li>Skip whitespace and comments.</li>
    <li>If at end of line or no longer on the original line,
    return.</li>
    <li>Read one form and accumulate at the end of the list.</li>
    <li>If at end of line or no longer on the original line,
    return.</li>
    <li>Go to step 2.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The accumulated list is returned as the Scheme representation
  of the line directive. The list is not evaluated as Scheme code,
  but may be either ignored or passed to an implementation-defined
  facility for processing.</p>
  <h3>Recursive line directives</h3>
  <p>It is an error to write things like <code>#! #! foo</code> or
  <code>#! outer (#! inner)</code>.</p>
  <h3>Equivalence of <code>#! r6rs</code> with a space and
  <code>#!r6rs</code> without</h3>
  <p>It is implementation-defined whether <code>#! r6rs</code>
  (with whitespace), once read, is processed the same way or in a
  different way compared to <code>#!r6rs</code> (without
  whitespace).</p>
  <h3>Extending the formal syntax of R7RS</h3>
  <p>In R7RS section <code>7.1. Formal syntax</code>, add a new case to
  the definition of <code>&lt;directive&gt;</code>:</p>
  <pre>#! &lt;intraline whitespace&gt;+ &lt;directive datums&gt;</pre>
  <p>where</p>
  <pre>&lt;directive datums&gt; = | &lt;datum&gt; &lt;intraline whitespace&gt;* &lt;directive datums&gt;</pre>
  <p>and <code>&lt;datum&gt;</code> in this case contains no
  newlines in the datum or surrounding whitespace.</p>
  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <p>For clarity, all Scheme symbols in the examples are written
  using the <code>|vertical-bar|</code> syntax from R7RS.</p>
  <h3>Unix script interpreter</h3>
  <p>Line directive:</p>
  <pre>#! /usr/bin/env fantastic-scheme</pre>
